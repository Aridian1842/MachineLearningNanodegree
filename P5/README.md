# Predict The Next Pitch
### Define the problem
Baseball has become a very analytical sport and now it seems as if everything can be analyzed with data. In this new world, teams have started to implement numerous analytical techniques including defensive shifts, individual statistical importance, batter tendencies based on pitch locations, etc. This data based strategy had become popular from Billy Bean and his Sabermetrics. Here, I will try to apply another statistical approach on the basis on machine-learning by trying to predict the next pitch a pitcher will throw by incorporating information that is available to a batter such as the count, the current game state, pitcherâ€™s tendency to throw a particular type of pitch, etc. This becomes a multi-classification problem by predicting the next pitch type.
